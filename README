a little php class which can provide you an easy way to handle errors (even non recoverable errors like E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_ERROR)
it wraps the error to an ErrorException instance and throws the exception(for catchable errors) or calls the default exception handler (for fatal errors)

if you create an instance from PHP_Error_Handler without any arguments, it will call the global error/exception handler method, if it's available.

the first argument can be a callable variable, if set, that will be called instead of the global error/exception handler.

the second argument will be interpreted as a boolean value: if is set to true, the errors will be converted to ErrorException and passed to the exception handler (either to the global, or the one passed as argument).

the third argument will be interpreted as a boolean value: if is set to true, then the script will overwrite the global error handler if is set. (only required if $errorsToException is set to true and another error handler was set with set_error_handler)
 
BEWARE: you cannot continue the execution of your script on such errors, but with this script, you can gracefully terminate

see the src/demo.php for examples

Requirements: php 5.2.6
