a little php file (src/php-error-handler.php) which can provide you an easy way to handle errors (even non recoverable errors like E_ERROR, E_PARSE, E_CORE_ERROR, E_COMPILE_ERROR)

it wraps the error to an ErrorException instance and throws the exception(for catchable errors) or calls the default exception handler (for fatal errors)
 
BEWARE: you cannot continue the execution of your script on such errors, but with this script, you can gracefully terminate

see the src/demo.php for examples
